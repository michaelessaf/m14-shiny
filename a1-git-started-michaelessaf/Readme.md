George-Michael Bluth
====================

![Michael Cera] (imgs/Michael-Cera.gif)

George-Michael *embodies* awkwardness, he's socially unaware, mostly due to the helicopter-style parenting of his father. His exaggerated childishness combined with his aspirations and social obliviousness make for **very** good comedy. This is made funnier by the fact that when does occasionally interject a cogent point, his family is such a hive-mind of selfishness and privilege that they always shoot it down. His voice also emphasizes the comedy, itâ€™s *shrill* and *cracks* often, usually at the most inopportune times. 

The best things about George-Michael:
* His voice
* His love of French Cinema
* His commitment to the Bluth Frozen Banana Stand
